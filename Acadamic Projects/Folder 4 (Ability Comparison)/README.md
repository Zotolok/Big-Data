### Introduction
In this folder I will explain more about the knowledge I acquired from the project of Folder 2, and the abilities I got with it, along with the attitudes and principles I applied to them.

### "comentatiosPython"

#### Comments / Comentarios

I simply learned how to write comments in individual or multiple code lines. For my activities seems to be very useful for code documentation; sometimes I don't remember how my code works and having comments gives me a good context to remember faster. So, it is something that I use very often (not just in my "comentariosPython" project).


#### Concatenation and *print()*, *type()* functions / Concatenación y función *print()*, *type()*

Concatenation refers to the operation of joining two or more string or sequences together to form a united result. This is a common action while coding with, for example, *print()* function; that is used to display output to the console or other visual way. These are actions that I apply almost in every project to display custom results and mainly show something to users or me to know the result of a previous made action.

In the other hand, *type()* function (at least in Python) is used alongside with a variable to know its data type. I have used it in some projects to make output validations, but is not very common in my day-to-day work.


#### Basic Data Types, variables, and assignment / Tipos de datos básicos, variables, y su asignación

Basically, *int* is for numbers, *string* for texts, *char* for single character (such as "A", "1", "b"), and booleans for *true* or *false* values. This data types are assigned to a variabla that will have the data regarding that type. This is something necessary for any software since you make the proper operations and logic with them to get another output. So, it is something that I use in all my projects to assign and get the results used in functions to solve problems (like  coding exercises with data sets).


#### Mathematical operations with variables (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, square root) / Operaciones matemáticas con variables (suma, resta, mul, div, raíz cuadrada, residuo)

This is an example where you use your variables to get another result. 
```python
# Basic Operations in Python / Operaciones básicas en Python

# Example 1
a = 10
b = 5

# Addition / Suma
suma = a + b
print(f"La suma de {a} y {b} es: {suma}")

# Subtraction / Resta
resta = a - b
print(f"La resta de {a} menos {b} es: {resta}")

# Multiplication / Multiplicación
multiplicacion = a * b
print(f"La multiplicación de {a} por {b} es: {multiplicacion}")

# Division / División
division = a / b
print(f"La división de {a} entre {b} es: {division}")
```

I use any of the basic operations for my coding tests to get, for example, the total money gained per month in a year depending on worked hours, or for a program that calculates the rule of three.


#### User inputs / Entradas de usuario

*input()* function is used to let the user write in the console or front view. For example, if a program asks the user a name, surely there will be a text box to do it. Inputs are very important because they are the way in which people can interact directly with the software. This knowledge is absolutely necessary in my daily life as a software engineer; for personal projects, academic projects, and more from any kind.

### Reflection 1

I would say that the attitudes regarding this project/activity were more related to curiosity. Since it was one of my first coding activities I felt a little confuse for the amount of information about the basics. And the prominent principle I would consider for this activity is the sense of responsability to do a good job on time.

### "Avance 2 Evidencia (Parte II) - Big Data"

#### To import libraries

Since some topics ago during this certificate, my classmates and I learned how to import the proper libraries to use specific classes and functions to do our works. Libraries like pandas, from Python, helped us to read, create, and display charts from a *.csv* archive (with data of any topic) and apply lots of actions with them (concatenation of columns with *concat()* or to simply get some rows from a table with *head()* when cosntructing your table with the *.DataFrame()* class from *pandas* library); something done lots of times in this project.


#### Functions, Loops, Conditionals, & Data Structures

In this project I used a lot of functions that helped me to display certain outputs from the information gave to me (both the default ones from python and others created by me using loops and conditionals); like a function that displays the mean of confirmed *covid* cases per month (using my own function with others like *concat()*, *print()*, and *len()* applied to dictionaries and arrays) or a function that displays the percentage of affected population per month (using my own function with others like *item()*, *print()*, and *len()* applied to dictionaries and arrays, too). I applied these functions in this project due to my exercises, but I think that I can use the knowledge from here to create and master how to create better functions in my other activites and job, because their bases are the same (at least in Python).

### Reflection 2

In this project I used almost everything I learned in all the projects regarding Python. The main attitudes about this activity I would say were proactivity and resilience; proactivity due to I felt possitive after lots of practices and I took control of situations before the become issues; and resilience as I had to work a lot to gather all the knowledge learned and make something from it. In the other hand, the main principles I felt were the responsability and perseverance for my works.

### Conclusion

From the very beginning of my academic journey, I consider that I always had the will to improve. Nevertheless, when I entered college, I really felt everything very difficult and that everyone around me was far better than me. So, I had to practice harder to understand the topics; and I would say that I had "evolved" and changed my mindset from one of just traying to get a 90 grade, to really learn, to have the curiosity and the resilience to face what I have in front of me.

In summary, I think that, throughout the certificate, I learned a lot about the programming bases with the loops, data types, data structures, conditionals, functions, and more. Knowledge that I needed and actually need to continue practicing for my last academic projects and job; since, despite I can use these bases beyond Python and Big Data, there is always something to be mastered or new to learn. Like to practice my programming logic with loops and conditionals, and my data structure management regarding data collection and displays since I have not given me enough time to practice them. If I want to create software with all I have seen in my certificates, practice is key; and I consider myself better than others when it comes to making an effort.
